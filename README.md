### [huffman_encoder](huffman_encoder.py)
Lossless compression of bit strings using Huffman coding.
Huffman encoding assigns a binary value to each character, with the shortest binary value representing the most commonly used character.

### [dictionaryMaker](dictionaryMaker.py)
Reads a file or directory, parses words, adds them to a dictionary, and saves it as a file that can be read by the [flashcards](flashcards.py) script.


### [flashcards](flashcards.py)
